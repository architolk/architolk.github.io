The Mikrophonie is a Eurorack Module originally created by Tom Whitwell. Later versions include the Music Thing Modular Ears. Both modules contain a pre amp to have an input into your modular for non-Eurorack level audio signals. And it includes a piezo contact microphone, making you modular case itself an instrument.

My version is an instrument on its own. It is intended to work as a separate device, have its own power supply and some specific sound properties (woodblock, spring, metal keys). But with also the possibility to work as a regular pre amp. Output should at least be the audio at Eurorack level, but maybe we include some of the other circuit of the Ears module as well.
