Anybody who has watched the original Battlestar Galactica series knows how a vocoder sound: the "By your command" is arguably the most famous words phrased using a vocoder.

And also in pop music, this effect is used to create a robotic feel to the song. Of course Kraftwerk's robots and autobahn. But also more as a regular effect in Earth, Wind & Fire's Let's groove. And more recently Daft Punk uses a vocoder, for example in Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger. Or Beastie Boy's Intergalactic.

And with all good musical effects, the original vocoder sound was all analog! So let's create such a beast again! (And stop using autotune, that sucks).
