Audio should be saved to as raw audio, 48kHz audio, 16 bit mono or stereo. See also [How to load audio files / Create Tables](http://community.axoloti.com/t/how-to-load-audio-files-create-tables/537) on the axoloti forum.

Filename should not exceed 8 characters.

Steps to do this:

1. Create a wav audio sample, 48kHz 16 bit mono or stereo;
2. Strip the wav header from the audio file (you might use [riffstrip](https://mark0.net/soft-riffstrip-e.html));
3. Choose a filename, max 8 characters, ".raw" extension;
4. Upload to the filesystem (set the axoloti in SD-card mode).
