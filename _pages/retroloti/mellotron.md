The Mellotron patch is from the community patch library. The sound tapes are from [Sonic boom](https://sonicbloom.net/en/tag/sonic-bloom-live-pack/), but probably originally from [Leisureland, Tajiguy](http://www.leisureland.us/mellotron.htm)

The patch was originally made by [Kai Drange](http://community.axoloti.com/u/Abhoth), see [Abhoth contributions, Mellotron](http://community.axoloti.com/t/abhoth-contributions/4004/3?u=abhoth).

The 10 Mellotron sound tapes are:
1. Choir
2. Chello
3. M300 A
4. M300 B
5. M300 Brass
6. mk2 Brass
7. mk2 Flute
8. mk2 Violins
9. String Section
10. Woodwinds

The 11th sound tape currently contains samples from the opening lines of the song "Vinyl Dogs Vibe" by Lord Finesse as they were used by Fatboy Slim to create the hook for The Rockafeller Skank.
