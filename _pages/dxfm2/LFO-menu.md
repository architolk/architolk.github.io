|Op|Setting|Description|
|--|-------|-----------|
| 6|Amplitude depth|Global effect of the LFO on the amplitude|
| 5|Pitch depth|Global effect of the LFO on the pitch|
| 4|LFO fade|Speed at which the effect of the LFO fades away|
| 3|LFO sync|Single of multiple LFO's / Key synchronised or free running LFO's|
| 2|LFO speed|Speed of the LFO|
| 1|LFO waveform|Select between: Triangle, Sinus|
| 0|Output volume||

The effect that the LFO has on a particular operator also depends on the setting for that particular operator (see below).

## Ratio, pitch and feedback (Keyboard level scale)

![](/assets/images/dxfm2/LFO-Ratio.png)

Not so much a LFO setting, with these three blue buttons you can change the keyboard level scale for each operator

- **Ratio** changes the left depth & curve (press ratio button to toggle between these two);
- **Pitch** changes the keyboard breakpoint;
- **Feedback** changes the right depth & curve (press feedback button to toggle between these two).

## Duration (LFO pitch sensitivity)

![](/assets/images/dxfm2/LFO-Duration.png)

Changes the effect the LFO has on the pitch of a particular operator. Please note that the effect of LFO also depends on the global setting of the Pitch depth (see above).

## Level (LFO amplitude sensitivity)

![](/assets/images/dxfm2/LFO-Level.png)

Changes the effect the LFO has on the amplitude of a particular operator. Please note that the effect of LFO also depends on the global setting of the Amplitude depth (see above).
