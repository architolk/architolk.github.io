## Simple FM: one carrier, one modulator
The basic mathematical function for simple FM looks surprisingly simple:

\\[y = sin(x+sin(x))\\]

In this formula, a sine wave is modulated with another sinewave with the same frequency. Let:

- \\(F_c\\) the frequency of the carrier;
- \\(F_m\\) the frequency of the modulator;
- \\(C\\) the frequency-ratio of the carrier (we will mostly use \\(C=1\\));
- \\(M\\) the frequency-ratio of the modulator;
- \\(I\\) the modulation index: the amount of modulation;
- \\(k=0,1,2,3,..\\) the sideband order \\(k\\)

Using \\(C\\), \\(M\\) and \\(I\\) in the original formula, we get:

\\[y = sin(Cx+I*sin(Mx))\\]

To compute the actual frequency spectrum, we need to consider the sidebands from the original carrier frequency \\(F_c\\). The 0th order sideband is the frequency \\(F_c\\). Sideband orders range from \\(k=0,1,2,3,..\\) Both left sidebands (frequencies to the left of the carrier frequency) and right sidebands (frequencies to the right of the carrier frequency) occur. The actual frequencies of such a sideband is related to the modulation frequency:

\\[F_c Â± k*F_m\\]

You only have to compute the \\(I+2\\) order sideband, all other sidebands will have a negible amplitudes.

The amplitude of a particular order sideband \\(k\\) is calculated using the Bessel function of the same order \\(k\\) of the modulation index \\(I\\):

\\[Amplitude = J_k(I)\\]

A sideband corresponds to a frequency, so we get the amplitude of the sine wave for that frequency. But we have some things to consider:

- A sideband at frequency 0Hz is actually a DC offset, so if such a sideband would occur we can ignore this sideband.
- Bessel functions with order above 3 can have negative results, so the calculated amplitude is actually negative.
- Odd sidebands to the left of the original frequency have a phase shift of 180 degrees. As such a phase shift for a sine wave corresponds to a negative amplitude of the original phase, this can be represented by a sign change of the amplitude. The same result can be found by using negative orders for the Bessel function: \\(J_{-k}(I) = -J_k(I))\text{ for odd n}\\).
- A wave with a negative frequency is actually a wave with the same positive frequency, but with a phase shift of 180 degrees: if you would "plot" a negative frequency: the sine wave would go "back" along the x axis, which looks like the same sine wave going forward along the x-axis, but with just a phase shift of 180 degrees. And such a phase shift is simply a sign change of the amplitude. This means that we can consider a sideband with a negative frequency as a sideband with the same positive frequency, but with a sign-change of the amplitude (positive becomes negative, negative becomes positive).
