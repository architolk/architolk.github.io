The EF86 tube used in the AC5 is an Electro-Harmonix tube, manufactured in the old Sovjet-era tube factory in Saratov, Russia. Not that many tube factories exists nowadays, and most brands are actually rebranded tubes from one of a very few still [existing factories](https://hackaday.com/2020/08/06/just-who-makes-tubes-these-days/).

The pinout and most fundamental characteristics can be found in the [EHX EF86 datasheet](https://shop.ehx.com/catalog/addimages/ef86eh.pdf):

|Pin|Name| Description |
|---|----|-------------|
| 1 | g2 | Screen grid |
| 2 | s  | Screen (chassis ground screen) |
| 3 | k  | Cathode |
| 4 | f  | Filament heater pin |
| 5 | f  | Filament heater pin |
| 6 | a  | Anode (plate) |
| 7 | s  | Screen (chassis ground screen) |
| 8 | g3 | Suppressor grid |
| 9 | g1 | Control grid |

Unfortunately, the datasheet doesn't provide a diagram with the [static anode characteristic curves](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/electronic_components/valves-tubes/triode-valve-vacuum-tube-formula-theory.php). A lot of datasheets can be found via the [duncanamps.com datasheet search engine](http://tdsl.duncanamps.com/tubesearch.php). This search results in a peculiar result: the EHX EF86 datasheets seems the be copied from a [Philips EF86 datasheet](http://frank.yueksel.org/sheets/010/e/EF86.pdf)! An [older version of this datasheet](http://www.r-type.org/pdfs/ef86-1.pdf) actually has some diagrams, and it is this datasheet that has [actually been used by the VOX designer of the original AC4/AC15](https://www.ampbooks.com/mobile/classic-circuits/vox-ac15/).

Sidenote: the figure is *from* the EF86 datasheet, but it states EF40. The EF40 is the precursor to the EF86, electronically they are [the same](http://www.tube-classics.de/TC/Tubes/Common%20EF40/EF40.htm).

## EF86 tube analysis

For tube analyses, the diagram below gives the usual structure.

The result of this analyses, when plotting the current of the Anode, gives:

The [duncanamps SPICE model](http://www.duncanamps.com/pdf/ef86spicemod.pdf) was used for this simulation and is considered to be one of the best versions. However: it differs a bit from the diagram out of the Philips datasheet (which is actually dated at 1948 (!)), so who knows which version is more correct with respect to the EHX EF86...
