Building the AC5:

- Changing the original 6.5 inch VOX speaker with a 8 inch Celestion speaker.
- Removing the case of the Pathfinder 10 and removing all internals
- Drilling new holes in the original Pathfinder 10 case.
- Building the Molly Kit
- Installing everything
- First test! Using a light bulb current limiter

I got some inspiration from these youtube videos:
- [Stefans Guitars - Building our own tube amp, part 1](https://youtu.be/EGZEgBNAKxM), [part 2](https://youtu.be/kn6WKTkKwtQ), [part 3](https://youtu.be/fnh4aY1C9QA), [part 4](https://youtu.be/Tf0nXF1losE) and [part 5](https://youtu.be/O_SStu3ECvI). Not the Molly, but another kit from TubeTown.
- [Molly kit Tube Town by Stalker effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kaimab6wDFA), it's a custom build using the old version of the kit.
