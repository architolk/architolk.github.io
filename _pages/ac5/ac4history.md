"*The Vox AC-4 was a small guitar practice amp that was introduced in 1958 and originally marketed as the AC-2*", according to [The vox showroom](http://www.voxshowroom.com/uk/amp/ac4.html).

The 1960 AC-4 contained a 8 inch speaker and three valves in the signal path: EF86, 12AX7 and EL84 power tube. A fourth valve is used for rectification (an EZ80). The circuit diagram for the original AC-4 amp can be found the [KORG UK site](https://www.korguk.com/voxcircuits/)).

The AC-4 is a [Single Ended Power Output Stage](http://www.valvewizard.co.uk/se.html) amplifier, using one EL84 pentode power tube.
