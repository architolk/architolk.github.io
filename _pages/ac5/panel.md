The original pathfinder operating panel has the following items:

- An input jack socket;
- Gain knob;
- Overdrive/clean selector;
- Treble knob;
- Bass knob;
- Volume knob;
- Head phone / Line out jack socket;
- Power LED
- Power switch

The Molly kit, however has a totally different other of items:

- Power switch
- Power light
- Volume knob
- Cut knob
- Gain knob
- Hi input jack socket
- Li input jack socket

I decided not to mirror the internals of the Molly, so I needed to mirror the input & outputs. Most holes needed to be enlarged, so no problems there. The power switch had a rectangular hole and I didn't want to use the LED hole: a small aluminium plate fixed this. Below the result!

Chickenhead knobs are to be ordered... The original pathfinder used self-tapping knobs, the Molly kit had set-screw pots, so I need to order some new knobs :-(.

So the dials are:

- Treble: master volume
- Bass: cut
- Volume: gain (overdrive from level 5 and up)
