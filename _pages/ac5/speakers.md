The original 6.5 inch VOX speaker is replaced with a 8 inch Celestion speaker. The new speaker is a lot heavier and also deeper: it is a tight fit between the front of the cabinet and the chassis of the amplifier circuit. I didn't enlarge the cloth gap, this is still original. Below both speakers in the same picture.

After removing the chassis with the amp circuit, the original 6.5 inch speaker is visible.

Some wood needs to be cut away, this way the new 8 inch speaker fits just perfectly within the cabinet.
