The iconic AC30 is used by many artists, notably Brian May of Queen. However the shear volume of the AC30 makes it impossible to use it at the appropriate level (a.k.a. as "11") in the studio.

The original AC4, using an EF86 pentoid pre-amp tube, is only available as vintage amp (read: expensive), the new AC4's are equiped with "normal" 12AX7s triod tubes. So.. how do we get to the AC5?

A German company sells the TT Molly kit, which is inspired by the original AC4. The bare kit only contains the needed components, without a case or a body enclosure.

Luckily, VOX sells the Pathfinder 10, a small solid state practice amp. This amp contains a body and a steel case for the components! It may seem kinda weird to by a complete product, and strip it from all its part, but in this way: the outside IS essentially a VOX amp :-).
