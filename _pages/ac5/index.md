The iconic AC30 is used by many artists, notably Brian May of Queen. However the shear volume of the AC30 makes it impossible to use it at the appropriate level (a.k.a. as [this one should go to 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven)) in the studio.

The [original AC4, using an EF86 pentode pre-amp tube](http://www.voxshowroom.com/uk/amp/ac4.html), is only available as a vintage amp (read: expensive), the [new AC4's are equiped with regular 12AX7s triode tubes](https://voxamps.com/product/ac-4-custom-vintage-black-series/). So.. how do we get to the AC5?

A [German company sells the TT Molly kit](https://www.tube-town.net/cms/?DIY/LoW-Projekte/Molly_-engl-), which is inspired by the original AC4 / AC30. The bare kit only contains the needed components, without a chassis or a cabinet enclosure.

Luckily, [VOX sells the Pathfinder 10](https://voxamps.com/product/pathfinder-10/), a small solid state practice amp. This amp contains the body and the steel chassis for the components! It may seem kinda weird to buy a complete product, and strip it from all its part, but in this way: the outside IS essentially a VOX amp :-).

The Pathfinder 10 is equiped with a 6,5 inch VOX special made speaker, but can actually hold (with some tinkering), an 8 inch Cellestion speaker, making it even more the AC5 we are looking for.
