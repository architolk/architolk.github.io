The circuit for the AC5 is, as you might expect, the circuit for the TT Molly kit. A single EF86 pentode is used as for the preamp input tube (as in the original AC4/AC10/AC15 and the very first AC30/4), followed by a 12AX7 dual triode rectifying tube, going into the two parts of the ECC99 dual triode tube. The ECC99 is normally not used as a power tube, but in this small package, it delivers about 4 watts of power, as the original AC4.

And, in fashion with the original VOX AC2/AC4/AC6 (which are actually the same 4 watt amplifiers...), we simply call it the AC5.

This gives is a tube amplifier with an original AC30/4 preamp circuit, and a push/pull power amplifier circuit, as in all AC30s (but not in the original AC4!).
