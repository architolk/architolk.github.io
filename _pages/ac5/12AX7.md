The 12AX7 (also called ECC83S) tube used in the AC5 is a JJ Electronic tube, manufactured in the tube factory in ÄŒadca, Slovakia. JJ Electronic is actually only founded in 1993, but they use the old machinery from the old Sovjet-era TESLA company. Not that many tube factories exists nowadays, and most brands are actually rebranded tubes from one of a very few still [existing factories](https://hackaday.com/2020/08/06/just-who-makes-tubes-these-days/).

The pinout and most fundamental characteristics can be found in the [JJ ECC83S datasheet](https://www.jj-electronic.com/images/stories/product/preamplifying_tubes/pdf/ecc83s.pdf):

|Pin|Name| Description |
|---|----|-------------|
| 1 | a' | Anode (plate) 2nd tube|
| 2 | g' | Grid 2nd tube |
| 3 | k' | Cathode 2nd tube |
| 4 | f  | Filament heater pin |
| 5 | f  | Filament heater pin |
| 6 | a  | Anode (plate) 1st tube |
| 7 | g  | Grid 1st tube |
| 8 | k  | Cathode 1st tube |
| 9 | fc | Center tap filament |

The datasheet provide a diagram with the [static anode characteristic curves](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/electronic_components/valves-tubes/triode-valve-vacuum-tube-formula-theory.php):

## 12AX7 tube analysis

For tube analyses, the diagram below gives the usual structure.

The result of this analyses, when plotting the current of the Anode, gives:

The original 12AX7A tube model provided with LT-Spice was used for this simulation. However: it differs a bit from the diagram provided by JJ Electronic. So we might have to look for a different model that corresponds more to the datasheet.
