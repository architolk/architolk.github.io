As we all know, the internet is a black box, with a small red blinking light. It's of course wireless and the internet doesn't weigh anything.

The dimensions of the box are shrouded in mystery ;-). [Some say](https://www.diynerds.com/build-the-it-crowd-internet-black-box/) it's the [Hammond 1591ESBK ABS Project Box Black](https://www.hammfg.com/electronics/small-case/plastic/1591). This could be correct as the WxD*H of this box is 191 x 110 x 61mm, which seems to be the right dimensions from the episode (the height of the box is about the size of four fingers). A somewhat larger box is the [Gainta G1025B](https://www.gainta.com/en/g1025b.html) with dimensions of 197 x 113 x 63.
