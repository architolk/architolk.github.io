The guitar player in our band didn't have a spring reverb in his guitar amplifier. He used a regular vocal reverb, which was of course totally inadequate ðŸ˜€. So I made one for him to use. This one doesn't use a real spring reverb tank, but is based around the very good sounding BTDR-3H reverb brick, making it a spring reverb in-a-box, nicely available as a regular stomp box.

This particular spring reverb is based on the [3Verb kit](https://www.musikding.de/3verb-reverb) from das Musikding.de.
