In every house, the toilet is the place to have a birthday calendar. But why not integrate such a calendar with more information? Like daily or weekly information? This project will use two e-ink displays and an ESP32 (in low energy consumption mode) to make this possible. This is put into a regular photo-frame, so it will just look like a regular calendar!

Some information:

- [Youtube: ESP32 Firebeetle with E-Paper Display](https://youtu.be/_QKqulZvJ2E?feature=shared)
- [ESP32 E-Paper Weather Display](https://www.hackster.io/lmarzen/esp32-e-paper-weather-display-a2f444)
- [Youtube: waveshare HAT - connection options](https://youtu.be/f4yoYbSWctI?feature=shared), this shows how you can connect the screen directly to the HAT.
