In every house, the toilet is the place to have a birthday calendar. But why not integrate such a calendar with more information? Like daily or weekly information? This project will use two e-ink displays and an ESP32 (in low energy consumption mode) to make this possible. This is put into a regular photo-frame, so it will just look like a regular calendar!
