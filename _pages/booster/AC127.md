{% include math %}
The AC127 transistor is a NPN style Germanium transistor, the sister of her PNP counterpart [AC128](/booster/AC128).

We won't use this germinium transistor, but a good SPICE model exists for this transistor, as part of the [LT wiki](http://ltwiki.org) components library and circuits: [standard.bjt](http://ltwiki.org/index.php?title=Standard.bjt).

[This](/assets/spice/booster/AC127-hFE.asc) spice model is used to measure the hFE and leakage of this particular transistor.

The hFE and leakage for this transistor is measured again, using the same circuit, but this time for an PNP transistor. Leakage is 0.36mA, which is a bit high to be used for a germanium transistor (0.1mA is perfect, 0.2mA is fine, more than 0.3mA is suspicious and more than 0.5mA is just plain bad), and hFE = 95.
