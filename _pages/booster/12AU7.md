The 12AU7 is a triode Tube. It is used in the starvation area, as we will use the tube at low voltage (12V): the "normal" operating voltage of a tube is over 100V! The valve wizard has done some research into the topic and provides us with the characteristics at low volume.

Although it is not perfect, the 12AU7 SPICE model operates OK at that level, according to the same figure, created with LTSpice.
