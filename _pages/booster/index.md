After creating the AC5, a treble booster should be the next project, to recreate the famous Brain May sound!

The idea is to create some kind of "uber" booster, making it possible to use different configurations (a valve tube, a germanium transistor and a silicon transistor) and maybe also some tweaking for input condensators (changing the RC filter). The booster will also have a bias resistor trim pot.
