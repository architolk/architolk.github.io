{% include math %}
The AC128 transistor is a PNP style Germanium transistor, the sister of her NPN counterpart [AC127](/booster/AC127).

We won't use this germinium transistor, but a good SPICE model exists for this transistor, as part of the [LT wiki](http://ltwiki.org) components library and circuits: [standard.bjt](http://ltwiki.org/index.php?title=Standard.bjt).

[This](/assets/spice/booster/AC128-hFE.asc) spice model is used to measure the hFE and leakage of this particular transistor.

The hFE and leakage for this transistor is measured again, using the same circuit, but this time for an PNP transistor. Leakage is 0.10mA, which is pretty Ok for a germanium transistor, and hFE = 62.
