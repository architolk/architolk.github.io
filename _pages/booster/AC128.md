{% include math %}
The AC128 transistor is a PNP style Germanium transistor.

It is quite hard to get a good LT Spice model for this transistor. In [this](/assets/spice/booster/AC128-hFE.asc) spice model, one is used (don't know any more from where - have to find out again).

The hFE and leakage for this transistor is measured again, using the same circuit, but this time for an PNP transistor. Leakage is 0.10mA, which is pretty Ok for a germanium transistor, and hFE = 62.
