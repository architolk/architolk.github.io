The BC549C transistor is a NPN style transistors. The transistor is very common and made by a lot of manufacturers. [all transistors](https://alltransistors.com/transistor.php?transistor=23419) has a cross reference check with the most common characteristics:

|Property|Value|
|--------|-----|
|Polarity| NPN |
|Max Collector Power Dissipation (Pc) | 0.5W |
|Max Collector-Base Voltage (Vcb) | 30V |
|Max Collector-Emiter Voltage (Vce) | 30V |
|Max Collector Current (Ic max) | 0.1A |
|Max Operating Junction Temperature (Tj) | 150°C |
|Transition Frequency (Tj) | 200MHz |
|Collector Capacitance (Cc) | 4.5pF |
|Forward Current Transfer ratio (hFE) | Min 420 |

The "C" in "BC549C" refers to the hFE category of the transistor. The hFE value can change dramatically between transistors, even within batches of the same manufacturer (this is why match pairs is in some cases such an important thing!). "A" is the lowest hFE category. Without a reference to a category, it might be anything within the range for that particular transistor type.

As BJT transistors are current controlled (and not voltage controlled like tubes and FET transistors), we use a current source to get the characteristics curves, using the following [SPICE model](/assets/spice/booster/BC549C.asc):

Note that these curves are only valid for a particular hFE, so they might be much different per transistor: that's maybe the reason that such curves are not part of the regular datasheets?

To check the actual hFE of an NPN transistor, we can use the following circuit:

The value for R1 and R2 are chosen to make it easier to translate the voltage at Vprobe to the hFE gain. Assuming a voltage drop over Vbe = 0.7, the actual voltage drop over R2 will be 8.3V, so the base current will be 8.3V/2.2Meg = 3.773uA. We won't measure the current at the collector, but we can measure the voltage drop over R1. So with R1 = 2651 this corresponds nicely (2651 * 0.3773 = 1000).

To use the BJT as an effective voltage amplifier, the following [topology](/assets/spice/booster/BC549C-amp.asc) can be used.

Vin is the incoming voltage. Rsig = 50 Ohm and Rpd (pulldown) = 1Meg. We could leave these resistors out of the circuit, but they will effect the circuit a bit. Vout is the outgoing, amplified voltage. Rload = 50k, representing the load of the following part of the circuit.

C1 and C2 are coupling capacitors that separate the AC incoming and outgoing voltage from the DC voltage offset necessary for the operation point of the transistor. As we will see, the values of C1 and C2 matter a lot, because they will block certain frequencies to an extent, depending on the size of the capacitor. Also, these capacitors might result in a phase shift between Vin and Vout.

Rc is the collector resistor. The value of this resistor in combination with Re dictates the angle of the load line and as such the current amplification factor (as Rc>>Re, Rc matters most). Re is the emitter resistor. The actual gain of the amplifier can be calculated as (roughly) Rc/Rb.

Rb1 and Rb2 form a resistor divider, setting the DC bias voltage for the base of the transistor. For maximum potential voltage swing of the input, the bias point is set at half Vcc, in this case Vce = 6V. Using this method of biasing greatly reduces the effect of the hFE by holding the Base DC bias at a constant level regardless the hFE value.

Resistor Re is used for stability of the circuit and as a general rule of thumb, the voltage drop across this resistor is generally 1/10 of the supply voltage, so Ve = Vcc / 10 = 12 / 10 = 1.2V.

## Finding Rc

Let's assume that we want to achieve a maximum Ic = 40mA. This will make Rc = (Vcc - Ve) / Ic = 10.8V / 40mA = 270 Ohm. We can now draw the load line, and find the Q-point at Vce = 5.4V. The maximum power of the BC549C is 0.5W, represented by the red line.

So Ic = (10.8-Vce)/270, at Vcc = 5.4V, Ic = 5.4/270 = 20mA. From this, we can get Ib ≈ 38.7uA. As hFE = Ic/Ib, we can calculate that for this SPICE model of the BC549C, the hFE = 517 at the Q-point of 5.4V.

As the actual amplification of the circuit depends on the quotient Rc/Re, we can change the loadline angle more to the "bottom" of the curveset. As is visible: the transistor is more lineair (horizontal line) with lower base currents. So if we want to achieve a lower q-point, we need to increase the value of Rc.

## Finding Re

IAs Ie = Ib + Ic ≈ Ic = 20mA, we can calculate the value of Re = 20mA/1.2V ≈ 20 Ohm, using Ohm's law.

## Finding Rb2

The current flowing through the voltage divider has to be large compared to the base current, so the voltage divider is not effected by the base current. A general rule of thumb is a value at least 10 times Ib. So Rb2 = (Ve + Vbe) / (10 * Ib). Vbe is the diode forward biased diode drop of the transistor, we'll use 0.7V. Rb2 = (1.2 + 0.7) / (10 * 38.7uA) = 1.9/430uA ≈ 3k

## Finding Rb1

If the current flowing through Rb2 is 10 times the current flowing through Ie, the current flowing through Rb1 should be 11 times. So Rb1 = (Vcc - (Ve + Vbe)) / (11 * Ib) = (12 - 1.3) / (11 * 43uA) = 10.7 / 473uA ≈ 22k7
