{% include math %}
The OC140 transistor is a NPN style Germanium transistor, so it should be useful for our Rangemaster-clone treble booster with "normal" negative ground.

An SPICE model for this transistor is very hard to find, the one in [this](https://audio-talk.co.uk/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=2098&start=30) link seems to be the only one available.

[This](/assets/spice/booster/OC140-hFE.asc) spice model is used to measure the hFE and leakage of this particular transistor.

The hFE and leakage for this transistor is measured again, using the same circuit, but this time for an PNP transistor. Leakage is 0.32mA, which is a bit high to be used for a germanium transistor (0.1mA is perfect, 0.2mA is fine, more than 0.3mA is suspicious and more than 0.5mA is just plain bad), and hFE = 99.

We use the same circuit as with the [BC594C](/booster/BC549C) to get the characteristics:

The resulting figure looks like:
