The fritzing [sketch](/assets/fritzing/booster/silicon.fzz) gives us the PCB for the silicon booster.

![](/assets/images/booster/silicon_pcb.svg)

A 10x16 grid is needed for this PCB (25.40mm x 40.64mm)

(NB: didn't include the resistor for the LED, so that needs to be include, or soldered to the LED itself)
