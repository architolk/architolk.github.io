The two 68uF and the 33uF capacitors are changed as a first guess as the faulty parts. No changes: still a lot of noise. But changing the 1G ohm bias resistor did result in a working (and silent, no self noise) microphone!

Below the before and after pictures. Getting components of the right size was a bit hard: most capacitors (for at least 50V) were to bulky. Some axial capacitors did the trick. As there was more space at the back of the PCB, the new 1G ohm resistor was placed at this side.
