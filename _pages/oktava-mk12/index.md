The Oktava M-12 Condenser microphone is a pretty good microphone, considering its price. Lot of information is available on the internet and this came in handy as one of the pair of microphones in my possession broke down. It did work, but a lot of noise was produced by the microphone.

During my quest to find the problem, a lot of interesting stuff became clear. So this was also an investigation in the way condensor microphones work (using phantom power)!
